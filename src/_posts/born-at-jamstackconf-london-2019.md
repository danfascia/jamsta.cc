As I sat at the first ever JAMStack conf in London in sunny July 2019 I found myself thinking - I need to start a JAMstack site. I'm too invested and knowledgeable about this topic to just sit here and watch. _So here it is..._

<!--more-->

I've been playing with JAMstack sites since 1998, of course they weren't called that back then... not until Matt Biilman from Netlify and Vitaly Friedman from Smashing Magazine got together and had the lightbulb moment. But ever since then the term has stuck and it has grown in ubiquity... I'm fine with that and it opens up the potential for a lot of silly jam analogies.

## What is the purpose of this site

In many ways it will be my own opinionated compilation of things that I'm finding useful or interesting in the JAMstack world.

But; it will also be a compilation of _How tos_ which I find to be something lacking in the JAMstack world right now. I'm not talking about _How to do x with Vue_ type articles... I'm talking about _How to achieve a useful task  with an end purpose using JAMstack_.

Let's see how this goes, at worst it will become my own JAMstack blog, but it might just be something more useful. I feel the need to separate my concerns since being a developer is not my day job and I also need a personal website for my other work.
