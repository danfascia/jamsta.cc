title: Why JAMstack and why JAM Recipes?
---

JAM Recipes is an opinionated list of tools and workflows to help you build websites using the JAMstack methodology maintained by [@danfascia](https://twitter.com/danfascia) .

I decided to build this site because it was easy to start making JAMstack sites but difficult to find answers on _how to architect_ and _structure_ a new project. I kept hitting the same roadblocks - namely, I knew what I wanted to do and I had an idea which APIs, SaaS tools and technologies to use but I couldn't quite map out how to bring it all together.

## Mapping it out

I've decided to document my own journeys here as a journal of how I solved a certain JAMstack problem. I thought that if it is useful for me it might be for others and it serves as a good record to something I had to work through for _future me to remember_.

## Community Coding

The great thing about the JAMstack is that there is a sense of _novelty_ and _discovery_ which has been so lacking from the world of web and CMS for the last few years. People help each other, release great open source resources and hold great educational conversations (check out [The New Dynamic](https://join.slack.com/t/thenewdynamic/shared_invite/enQtMjkwNjYwNTY0NjkxLWI1NDhlNjZkZjA5ZGJmODE1OThiMjkwN2ZkMzE1YjEwN2YwNWUxYTNjZTUxMGQ2MzU3NWQ0YmVjNGU1NTkxMDk) on Slack  )
