# jamsta.cc is a site dedicated to JAMstack Recipes

JAM Recipes is an opinionated list of tools and workflows to help you build websites using the JAMstack methodology maintained by [@danfascia](https://twitter.com/danfascia) .

I decided to build this site because it was easy to start making JAMstack sites but difficult to find answers on _how to architect_ and _structure_ a new project. I kept hitting the same roadblocks - namely, I knew what I wanted to do and I had an idea which APIs, SaaS tools and technologies to use but I couldn't quite map out how to bring it all together.
